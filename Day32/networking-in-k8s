Pod to pod communication 
======================

	Ø Each pod gets one dynamic ip add
	Ø CNI plugin (container network intef):- flanner, calico, cilium)
	Ø Pods ip's are ephemeral (temporary, short-lived)

K8s network model
================

	Ø Flat network:- every pod can reach other pod in the cluster
	Ø All pods can communicate across nodes directly through cni plugin.

Ways pods communicate 
====================

	1. Direct IP-to-IP:- 
  ===============

	Ø Pod A > pod B using pods ip add they can communicate 

	2. Using service 
  ==============

	Ø Svc enables network access to the pods
	Ø Svc exposes the app
	Ø Svc gets one static virtual ip add is called clusterip or dns name
	Ø API server + controller manager provides ip add to svc in cluster
From svc cidr api-server and controller manager assigns ip add to the svc.
