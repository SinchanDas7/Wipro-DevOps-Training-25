Wt is Argocd
==========

	Ø It is a declarative , gitops-based continuous delivery tool for k8s
	Ø It will synchronize the desired state(stored  in git) with actual state (in k8s)
	Ø In short:- git is the source of the truth
	Ø Argocd ensures the cluster matches it


Why Argocd
==========

	Ø Traditional cd tools push deployments manually or via pipeline 
	Ø Argocd automates this by pulling desired manifests from git

Benefits
=======

	Ø Gitops model:- single source of the truth
	Ø Declarative :- infra  > app as code
	Ø Visibility:- web ui & cli to see real time app health
	Ø Mutli-cluster support:- manage multiple clusters from one control plane
	Ø Rollbacks:- just revert git commit

Argocd Architecture 
=================

	1. API server:- it will handle cli/ui requests, exposes REST
	2. Repository server:- it will connect to git/helm repo and it will pull manifests files
	3. Application controller:- it will reconcile desires state (git) vs live state (k8s cluster)
	4. Redis:- caching for performance 
	5. Web ui:- visualization of app state


Flow
====

Dev >  push code/manifest  > git repo  > Argocd > k8s cluster (sync)

Core concepts 
============

	1. Application:- a CRD (custom resource definition) representing what to deploy and where
	2. Project:- logical grouping of applications 
	3. Sync:- it will bring live cluster state in line with git
	4. Hooks:- presync, sync, postsync hooks for automation 
	5. Sync status:- synced and outofsync


Deployment strategies 
===================

	1. Manual sync:- admin trigger sync manually 
	2. Auto sync:- argocd automatically applies changes from git
Self heal:- if someone changes in the clusters argocd reverts it to match git
